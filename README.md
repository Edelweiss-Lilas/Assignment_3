# Assignment_3
My repository is about three catalogs of the library of the queen of France Marie-Antoinette. There are three samples of XML File who serve to create the ODD file at first. Then, I customize the ODD file by adding three rules. One is about the <material>normally it all only in the<msdescription> but I need to describe the material of the book so I change the rule in order to change the place that it normally belongs and allow me to put it in the <bibl>structure. The second is about defining a proper structure of the <bibl> element in which everyone has to respect the same order. The third is about the URL. I created this rule to specify by which element the URL must begin. The goal is to clarify the encoding. I only use AI to brainstorming my ideas and only when I feel completely stuck in my errors.
