# Assignment_3
My repository is about three catalogs of the library of the queen of France Marie-Antoinette. There are three samples of XML File who serve to create the ODD file at first. Then, I customize the ODD file by adding three rules. The first one is about the <material>normally it all only in the<msdescription> but I need to describe the material of the book so I change the rule in order to change the place that it normally belongs and allow me to put it in the <bibl>structure. The second rule is about defining a proper structure of the <bibl> element in which everyone has to respect the same order. The last one is about the URL. Sometimes you could paste the wrong link and then you can’t find your document. I created this rule to specify by which element the URL must begin. The goal is to clarify the encoding.
